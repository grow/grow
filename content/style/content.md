## Strings

- All content strings should be managed such that non-developers can make changes.

## Data

- Add as little as possible, but as much as necessary to the CMS to facilitate easy content management.
- Avoid placing too much information into the CMS, and look out for scenarios where content management may be simplified by hardcoding data in YAML files.
- Only place content in the CMS when, in doing so, management of the content is made simpler.

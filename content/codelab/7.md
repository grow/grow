Building your site is the process of taking your pod (the input) and generating static files (the output). To do this, Grow analyzes all of the config files (primarily `podspec.yaml` and `content` configs), and produces a list of resources to export, and then builds them.

The `grow build` command will build your site and dump the generated output to a directory on your computer. Let's give it a try. The following command will build your site and dump the files to a directory `build` within your pod. Note that you should not check the `build` directory into Git.

```bash
grow build ./my-codelab/
```

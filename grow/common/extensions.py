"""Loads extensions, with a workaround for the frozen version."""

# NOTE: Here be dragons, specifically for the packaged application. There are
# no dragons present here when Grow runs in the normal environment. The very
# concept of importing and running external "plugin-like" code is antithetical
# to PyInstaller, whose goal is to package everything necessary for running a
# program into a single executable. However, we need to support the extension
# system in Grow, allowing users to write and run arbitrary Python code (which
# may or may not depend on other, external libraries).
#
# We attempted to include the entire stdlib in with the packaged app
# (https://github.com/grow/grow/commit/b4530658), though that wasn't
# sufficient. The Python stdlib os.py module has its own platform-specific
# magic that is performed upon execution, which was bizarrely incompatible with
# PyInstaller's module importers (on sys.meta_path). Other users of
# PyInstaller, attempting to implement something similar, encountered similar
# errors (https://stackoverflow.com/q/35254139).
#
# Other bizarre errors, beyond os.py, related to the stdlib would occur.
# Specifically, modules had difficulty importing the `exceptions` module. None
# of these errors would occur if these libraries simply relied on the system's
# `site-packages` and system Python library. To permit extensions to rely on
# the system `site-packages`, we can import Python's `site` module, which
# configures `sys.path` depending on the system.  Normally that would be
# enough, but PyInstaller overwrites the system `site` module with a `site`
# module that specifically prevents this behavior
# (https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/510).
#
# So, in order to leverage the default `site.py` `sys.path` configuration, we
# overwite PyInstaller's `site` module with our vendored copy of the default
# `site` module from Python (which we're calling `patched_site.py`. This was
# not enough, though, and we had to make one modification to
# `patched_site.py`'s main: preventing a magic function (`abs__file__()`) from
# being executed since its behavior was also not compatible with PyInstaller.
#
# After all is said and done, we reset `sys.path` after the extension is
# loaded, to prevent any permanent changes during runtime. There may be a more
# intelligent way to fix this situation by writing a custom module loader and
# inserting it into `sys.meta_path`, but I was unable to do that.

Grow is a fresh, declarative, file-based static site generator for rapid
microsite production. Learn more at https://grow.io.

Key features:

- Data-driven: All your content is stored in YAML or Markdown, keeping content
  separate from presentation. Architect your site structure in YAML, then bind
  data to HTML templates to build your pages entirely around data from data
  files.
- Flexible URLs: Grow supports an explicit, configurable way to generate URLs
  for your site. Use template tags to keep your site maintainable and URL
  changes easy.
- Internationalization: Grow comes with flexible internationalization support
  included. Tag strings for translation, localize your content, and easily
  add/remove locales on a site-wide or per-document basis.
- Deploy anywhere: Grow builds your site to a static fileset, which means you
  can deploy pretty much anywhere. Grow comes built-in with deploy targets to
  various services.
